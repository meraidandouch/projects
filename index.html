                    Beyond my educational qualifications, I'm motivated by finding meaningful insights from complex genetic data and making these findings accessible through computational tools.
                    In undergrad, I worked as a research assistant studying the effects of anthropogenic led environmental stressors on California mussels 
                    such as extreme wave action, oxidation, rising temperatures, UV light exposure, and ingestion of microplastic adsorbing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). 
                    As one would presume, marine research is admirable, and I often had the opportunity to conduct field work in tide pools of the beautiful <a href="https://g.co/kgs/xpZWK9x"> Santa Rosa Island </a>. 
                    However, understanding marine life at a molecular and genetic level was what really shaped my passion for this field. 
                    My primary focus as a molecular team member, was to measure physiological phenotypic responses through qRT-PCR 
                    and transcriptomic methods.
                    <br><br>
                    Transitioning from analyzing ecological research to clinical omic-data bioinformatics involved learning new analysis techniques such as 
                    Python, R, SQL, NoSQL. This website showcases the diverse projects I've 
                    undertaken as a M.S. Bioinformatics student, as well as independently. Click the <strong> Projects </strong> tab to see more.

                    Overall, Iâ€™m fueled by my curiosity. I'm able to work flexibly within teams to meet their needs. 
                    My goal is always to stay aligned with the team and meet goals and deadlines while contributing postively 
                    to collaborative environments.

                <br> The breathtaking 
                and unforgettable views at the top made this challenge worth it!
